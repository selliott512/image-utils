If you're interested in how image-utils works or in contributing to it this
document may be helpful.

image-utils is written in Python, so it should work on most systems with a
reasonably recent version of Pillow installed.

To submit a change to image-utils fork it and send a pull request. It's github
page is https://github.com/selliott512/image-utils . If it's a lot of work and
you'd like to discuss it first you can reach me at selliott512@gmail.com

The organization and style of image-utils should be clear, but here are a few
highlights that apply to bin/image-utils.py:
1) Code is indented 4 spaces (no tabs).
2) Methods and variable names are lower case with underscores ("_").
3) It's divided into three sections:
    // Globals
    // Functions
    // Main entry
4) The functions are in alphabetical order.
5) The long version of command line options are in alphabetical order.

It's helpful to be familiar with the way coordinate systems work in graphics:
